Your December 1 project should take your project 2 assets (bootstrap css files) and incorporate topics 12 and 13 (javascript phases 1 and 2)
into it. Javascript programming features should be present on certain pages, such as iterating an array and using appendChild
within the loop, to automatically generate divs and other elements on the page. The array should contain hyperlinks which 
offer url parameters, which populate a detail page, as demonstrated in phases 1 and 2. 

Your pages can be deployed to a local web server (AWS not necessary). You can present your work in-class to the instructor.
